# Chapter-One - Notes On OOP Basics
---
Objects are instances of a `class`, classes are defined with the keyword `class` followed by the name of the class, commonly starts with an uppercase letter `NameOfClass`, the body of the class which is surrounded by curly braces `{ }`, is where we we declare variables and functions (methods) that all objects instantiated with this class share.
```
class NameOfClass {
    $var = "bodyOfTheClass";
    public function returnVar: string()
    {
        return $var;
    }
}
```
